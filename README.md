This is the source code for my Overhead Camera mod
Based off of Gubby's "IFeelLeftOut" https://github.com/Gubby0/IFeelLeftOut

The libs here are just the ones the project uses, you can find the complete set of available .dll files in Puck\Puck_data\Managed

http://discord.puckstats.io/ is the puck modding discord, which is also the best place to reach me for any feedback or suggestions (halios_ on discord)
